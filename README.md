# Project Description

We wish to create an interactive network of essays. Hundreds of compositions but primarily Presidential speeches will be analyzed, in order to provide a visual representation of similarity in terms of topics, themes, sentiments, etc. The aim is to enable users to examine clusters of speeches, and to facilitate inspection of their associations. This will provide an easy and intuitive way to compare and contrast writers, and perhaps discover common forms of variation in compositions.
